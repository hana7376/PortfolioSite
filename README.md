#Question 3- Have you done any programming in JavaScript before? Or in any other language? Scratch? Specify below. 
I have had a scratch acount, but I never learned anything, me and the people in the club were juts playing around, I haven't used any other progams besides what were doing in class 
#Question 4- Is there anything in particular you're interested in learning about in this course?  
I am just interested in making a website that looks newer, something I can use as a blog or a self promotuon site 
#question 5- Why did you sign up for this class? You can be honest. 
Originally,  I signed up for Dance but didn't get a spot, I was placed in a marketing class, and I tried to transfer into French but it wasn't available, I chose this class over the other three because it fits in with both my programs, GDM and SHSM ICT, and it will be a great learning experice for me, along with the fact that when I publish abother book I will be able to do everyyhing from scratch, website, cover, and book.
