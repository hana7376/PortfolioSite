<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>I am a writer, and highschool student. I love learning new things like languages, and new skills. I am in both a graphic design program and an information and communications technology program in my school, alongside many clubs. Besides school, I love to swim, dance, photography, and volunteer with young kids.
