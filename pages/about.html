<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p> My Writing Career </p>
   <p> My favorite author is J.K.Rowling, I am absolutly obessed with Harry Potter, her novel and life story 
       inspired me to become a writer because she got put down so many times, but she got through it all 
       and her series was discovered. I first really thought of writing as being an option in grade two 
       when my teacher told me she would love to read my short fanfictions in a real book. After that point, 
       I spent every free second writing in a notebook, pouring out all my imagination and in grade six I 
       shared my first book on the ebook website called Movella, and in grade seven, with the help of my 
       Language teacher I published my first book. I spent some time writing on Wattpad, Inkitt, and Instagram, 
       but now I mainly write for short story compitions, or novels on my own. I am looking to publsih my next 
       book by the end of grade twelve. </p>
