<h1>Tech Experience</h1>
<p>I do not have much experience with coding, but I have made two websites with the help of the programs Weebly and Wix, I also have done a few workshops through my school, but I do use Adobe programs, and am learning to use other programs like GitHub and Visual Studio Code among others.
